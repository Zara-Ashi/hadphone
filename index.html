        <h1> All new technology</h1>
        <p> In the last 60 years, technology has advanced leaps and bounds. From a one ton machine which could store 3.5
            MB data(IBM 350) to an SD card which can store 2 Terabytes of data and weighs only 2 grams, we have come a
            long way.One thing which has remained constant throughout this time is change. Technologies change every 2-3
            years and it is important for a professional who works in the technology space to keep themselves updated to
            climb up the career ladder fast!</p>
